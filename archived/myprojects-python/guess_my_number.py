instruction = '''-------------------------------INSTRUCTIONS------------------------------------
** This game is mainly based upon finding the guessed number by oppornent
as soon as possible.

** At first You have to decide the length of the number with which you are
going to play with computer.

** Some hints are provided to the player according to his/her/computer's
guessed number on the basis of the decided number by computer/player

                    ** hints are given as **

            * VALUE *                   * SYMBOL *
            
    right number & right position  ==>  Denoted by 'r'
    right number & wrong position  ==>  Denoted by 'w'
    number not present in guessed  ==>  Denoted by '-'

** There are options for playing both sides (e.g. deciding side & Guessing side)

                           HAVE FUN WITH THIS GAME.......
